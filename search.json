The researchers surveyed almost 900 women at the University Hospital of Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. The dataset includes numerical information such as the age of participants, number of sexual partners, or years using hormonal contraceptives and boolean information such as does the participant smoke, have HPV, or use an IUD.\nI wanted to investigate this topic because as a woman, women’s health is important to me. Women with health concerns are often discredited and their concerns ignored. It is all too common to hear stories of women going to their doctor for help and being told they’re wrong or overreacting, only to find out later their condition was as serious as they had thought and the doctor was wrong. In fact, 83% of women say they have felt discriminated against by doctors due to their gender (Pagán). It is important for women to be aware of behaviors that could be putting them at risk to protect themselves or to be able to recognize when their symptoms could be part of a bigger issue. The sooner a health condition is caught, especially one as serious as cancer, the sooner treatment can begin, and the better odds someone has of recovering.\nIn this project, I want to identify the risk factors that are most closely associated with getting cervical cancer.\n\n\nMethods\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport statistics as st\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport networkx as nx\n\n\nrawdata = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbraga12/DH140-FinalProject/main/cervical_cancer_risk_factors.csv')\ndata = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbraga12/DH140-FinalProject/main/cervical_cancer_risk_factors.csv')\n\nTo begin my analysis, I had to edit the data from the csv file. The authors had used ‘?’ to denote information they did not have. These values are not simple to work with so I needed to change them. I attempted to change them to None values, which is recognized as a null value.\nHowever, I also needed to change all the datatypes to integers. The authors had originally denoted some values as boolean but that did not transfer over to my Jupyter notebook in a way that I could easily use. By turning all the values into integers, it was simple to use the data as I wished. This caused an issue with my None values though. I could not do the data processing I because I could not figure out how to get around the None values. I tried using .isnull or == None, but nothing I tried would cause the script to ignore the values.\nIn the end, I set all the “?” values to zero. I determined that doing so did not change my average values significantly so I decided it was an acceptable assumption. It is important to note that for a few women, the data set will show 0 for their age at their first sexual experience. This is due to my editing and I will ignore these values when I examine that data.\n\n# Change ? in dataset to Zero\nfor i in rawdata:\n    data.loc[rawdata[i] == '?', i] = 0\n    \n# Convert at column datatypes into int\ncolumns = data.columns\nfor j in columns:\n    data[j] = pd.to_numeric(data[j])\n\n\nData Information\nI utilized data statistics to get a quick overview of the data I was working with and to ensure that the values I was seeing made sense. Before I removed the ‘?’ values and converted everything to integers, much of the information did not show up correctly. It was easy to address these errors when I could see them all laid out in front of me.\n\nrawdata.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Age\n      STDs: Number of diagnosis\n      Dx:Cancer\n

the studied behaviors and diagnoses affected the likelihood of developing cervical cancer. However, when looking at the data statistics it can be seen that only about 1% of the patients were diagnosed with CIN and 2% with cancer. That is too small of a population to analyze and draw conclusions from. I decided to pivot my exploration. In the the following Analysis section, I will explore the relationship between the risk factors surveyed for, STDs contraction rates, and medical testing for cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nRisk Factors vs STD Contraction\nThe first thing I wanted to delve deeper into was the percentage of women diagnosed with the various STDs the doctors were surveying for. This was done by making a dataset of these values and graphing them on a bar chart so it was easy to tell which were the most common and by how much. The bar chart shows condylomatosis, vulvo-perineal condylomatosis, and HIV being the most common STDs reported.\n\npercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'STD': ['condylomatosis','cervical condylomatosis','vaginal condylomatosis','vulvo-perineal condylomatosis',\n                      'syphilis','pelvic inflammatory disease','genital herpes','molluscum contagiosum','AIDS','HIV',\n                      'Hepatitis B','HPV'],\n              'Percentage': [data.loc[:, 'STDs:condylomatosis'].mean()*100, data.loc[:,'STDs:cervical condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             data.loc[:, 'STDs:vaginal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,data.loc[:,'STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             data.loc[:, 'STDs:syphilis'].mean()*100,data.loc[:,'STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease'].mean()*100,\n                             data.loc[:,'STDs:genital herpes'].mean()*100,data.loc[:,'STDs:molluscum contagiosum'].mean()*100,\n                             data.loc[:, 'STDs:AIDS'].mean()*100,data.loc[:,'STDs:HIV'].mean()*100,data.loc[:,'STDs:Hepatitis B'].mean()*100,\n                             data.loc[:, 'STDs:HPV'].mean()*100]})\n\npercentages.plot(x = 'STD', y = 'Percentage', kind = 'bar', ylabel = 'Percentage of Patients Diagnosed')\n\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='STD', ylabel='Percentage of Patients Diagnosed'>\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter getting an idea of what the total rates of STD contraction are in this survey, I looked at if individual risk factors led to higher or lower rates of STD contraction. I did this by making scatter plots with the frequency of the behaviors I was looking at plotted on the x axis and the number of STD diagnoses on the y axis.\nThe first plot I made displayed the relationship between the number of sexual partners a patient had and the number of STDs they had been diagnosed with. The scatter plot shows for people diagnosed with at least one STD, a wide range of sexual partners had been had. Looking at the extremes, the patient who had the most sexual partners, has been diagnosed with no STDS. The patient with the most STDS had an average number of sexual partners. The plot’s randomness led me to conclude that the number of sexual partners did not have a significant effect on whether or not a person has an STD.\n\ndata.plot(x = 'Number of sexual partners', y = 'STDs (number)', kind = 'scatter')\n\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='Number of sexual partners', ylabel='STDs (number)'>\n\n\n\n\n\nTo look more in depth at this, I grouped all the patients with the same number of diagnosed STDs and calculated their mean number of sexual partners, as can be seen below. The averages are all very close. Their closeness is supported by the significantly small standard deviation.\n\nfour = 0\nthree = 0\ntwo = 0\none = 0\nzero = 0\n\nfourc = 0\nthreec = 0\ntwoc = 0\nonec = 0\nzeroc = 0\n\nfor i in range(data.shape[0]):\n    if data.loc[i,'STDs (number)'] == 0:\n        zero += data.loc[i,'Number of sexual partners']\n        zeroc += 1\n    if data.loc[i,'STDs (number)'] == 1:\n        one += data.loc[i,'Number of sexual partners']\n        onec += 1\n    if data.loc[i,'STDs (number)'] == 2:\n        two += data.loc[i,'Number of sexual partners']\n        twoc += 1\n    if data.loc[i,'STDs (number)'] == 3:\n        three += data.loc[i,'Number of sexual partners']\n        threec += 1\n    if data.loc[i,'STDs (number)'] == 4:\n        four += data.loc[i,'Number of sexual partners']\n        fourc += 1\n\nprint(\"Average # of sexual partners, zero STDs  =\", zero/zeroc)\nprint(\"Average # of sexual partners, one STD    =\", one/onec)\nprint(\"Average # of sexual partners, two STDs   =\", two/twoc)\nprint(\"Average # of sexual partners, three STDs =\", three/threec)\nprint(\"Average # of sexual partners, four STDs  =\", four/fourc)\nprint(\"Standard deviation of averages = \", st.stdev([zero/zeroc,one/onec,two/twoc,three/threec,four/fourc]))\n\nAverage # of sexual partners, zero STDs  = 2.418485237483954\nAverage # of sexual partners, one STD    = 2.7941176470588234\nAverage # of sexual partners, two STDs   = 2.864864864864865\nAverage # of sexual partners, three STDs = 2.2857142857142856\nAverage # of sexual partners, four STDs  = 2.0\nStandard deviation of averages =  0.360017622025848\n\n\nI then looked at the relationship between the age of the patient at the time of their first sexual experience and the number of STDs the patient had. An extra step was taken to ensure my edited data did not affect the graph. Similar to above, the graph seems random. Regardless of how many STDs the patients have been diagnosed with, the average age is similar.\n\ntrunc_data = data.loc[(data['First sexual intercourse'] > 0.0)]\ntrunc_data.plot(x = 'First sexual intercourse', y = 'STDs (number)', kind = 'scatter', xlabel = 'Age of First Sexual Intercourse')\n\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='Age of First Sexual Intercourse', ylabel='STDs (number)'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks vs Testing\nAfter not forming a strong relationship between the behaviors and STDs, I decided to examine a relationship between the various risks and if a test for cervical cancer was performed on the patient. First, I looked at what STDs patients who had biopsies were diagnosed with and compared it to the rate of diagnoses of patients who did not undergo a biopsy. To display this information I made a bar chart similar to the one I made earlier, where the x axis shows the various STDs and the y axis shows the percentage. From the graphic, it can be seen that patients who underwent biopsies had significantly higher rates of condylomatosis, vulvo-perineal condylomatosis, and HIV. These can be noted as risks for cervical cancer based on that graphic.\n\nbiopsydata = data.loc[(data['Biopsy']==1)]\nnobiopsydata = data.loc[(data['Biopsy']==0)]\n\n\nbiopsystdpercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'STD': ['condylomatosis','cervical condylomatosis','vaginal condylomatosis','vulvo-perineal condylomatosis',\n                      'syphilis','pelvic inflammatory disease','genital herpes','molluscum contagiosum','AIDS','HIV',\n                      'Hepatitis B','HPV'],\n              'Percentage': [biopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:condylomatosis'].mean()*100, biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:cervical condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             biopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:vaginal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             biopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:syphilis'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease'].mean()*100,\n                             biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:genital herpes'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:molluscum contagiosum'].mean()*100,\n                             biopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:AIDS'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:HIV'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:Hepatitis B'].mean()*100,\n                             biopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:HPV'].mean()*100]})\nnobiopsystdpercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'STD': ['condylomatosis','cervical condylomatosis','vaginal condylomatosis','vulvo-perineal condylomatosis',\n                      'syphilis','pelvic inflammatory disease','genital herpes','molluscum contagiosum','AIDS','HIV',\n                      'Hepatitis B','HPV'],\n              'Percentage': [nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:condylomatosis'].mean()*100, nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:cervical condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:vaginal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:syphilis'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease'].mean()*100,\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:genital herpes'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:molluscum contagiosum'].mean()*100,\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:AIDS'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:HIV'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs:Hepatitis B'].mean()*100,\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'STDs:HPV'].mean()*100]})\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nX_axis = np.arange(biopsystdpercentages.shape[0])\n\nplt.bar(X_axis - 0.2, biopsystdpercentages['Percentage'], 0.4, label = 'Biopsy')\nplt.bar(X_axis + 0.2, nobiopsystdpercentages['Percentage'], 0.4, label = 'No Biopsy')\nplt.xticks(X_axis, biopsystdpercentages['STD'])\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper right\")\nplt.xticks(rotation='vertical')\nplt.ylabel('Percent of Patients Diagnosed')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nNext, I wanted to perform an analysis, similar to the first except on what I’m calling the “experience” information the patients. These risks include the patient’s age and number of sexual partners. The bar chart shows the average values for each group, biopsy or no, to be fairly similar. The average age for the group that underwent a biopsy is slightly higher, which makes sense because in general, people care about their health more as they’re older. Besides this slight discrepancy, the values are so close that it appears none of these factors influence the risk for cervical cancer.\n\n\nbiopsydemopercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'Experience': ['Age', 'Number of sexual partners', 'First sexual intercourse','Num of pregnancies'],\n              'Average': [biopsydata.loc[:, 'Age'].mean(), biopsydata.loc[:,'Number of sexual partners'].mean(),\n                             biopsydata.loc[:, 'First sexual intercourse'].mean(),biopsydata.loc[:,'Num of pregnancies'].mean()]})\nnobiopsydemopercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'Experience': ['Age', 'Number of sexual partners', 'First sexual intercourse','Num of pregnancies'],\n              'Average': [nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'Age'].mean(), nobiopsydata.loc[:,'Number of sexual partners'].mean(),\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'First sexual intercourse'].mean(),nobiopsydata.loc[:,'Num of pregnancies'].mean()]})\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nX_axis = np.arange(biopsydemopercentages.shape[0])\n\nplt.bar(X_axis - 0.2, biopsydemopercentages['Average'], 0.4, label = 'Biopsy')\nplt.bar(X_axis + 0.2, nobiopsydemopercentages['Average'], 0.4, label = 'No Biopsy')\nplt.xticks(X_axis, biopsydemopercentages['Experience'])\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper right\")\nplt.xticks(rotation='vertical')\nplt.ylabel('Average Value')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nNext I looked at some of the behavior differences between patients biopsied and not. From this bar chart, some interesting variance can be seen. The group that was biopsied has higher rates of smoking, using birth control (hormonal or IUD), and STDs. Given the bar chart, it can be infered that all these factors contribute to cervical cancer.\n\nbiopsybhrpercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'Behavior': ['Smokes','Hormonal Contraceptives','IUD','STDs'],\n              'Percentage': [biopsydata.loc[:, 'Smokes'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'Hormonal Contraceptives'].mean()*100,\n                             biopsydata.loc[:,'IUD'].mean()*100,biopsydata.loc[:,'STDs'].mean()*100]})\nnobiopsybhrpercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'Behavior': ['Smokes','Hormonal Contraceptives','IUD','STDs'],\n              'Percentage': [nobiopsydata.loc[:, 'Smokes'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'Hormonal Contraceptives'].mean()*100,\n                             nobiopsydata.loc[:,'IUD'].mean()*100,nobiopsydata.loc[:,'STDs'].mean()*100]})\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nX_axis = np.arange(biopsybhrpercentages.shape[0])\n\nplt.bar(X_axis - 0.2, biopsybhrpercentages['Percentage'], 0.4, label = 'Biopsy')\nplt.bar(X_axis + 0.2, nobiopsybhrpercentages['Percentage'], 0.4, label = 'No Biopsy')\nplt.xticks(X_axis, biopsybhrpercentages['Behavior'])\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper right\")\nplt.xticks(rotation='vertical')\nplt.ylabel('Percent of Patients Diagnosed')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nTo be thorough in my exploration of what risks lead to doctors checking for cervical cancer, I compared patients who underwent other tests for cervical cancer with patients who did not. These other tests are the Hinselmann test and the Schiller test. The results from the data analysis support the conclusions I came to after looking at the biopsy data. The factors that are more common in patients that were biopsied are the same for the patients that underwent other cervical cancer tests. The bar charts that display this data are all below.\n\nHinselmanndata = data.loc[(data['Hinselmann']==1)]\nnoHinselmanndata = data.loc[(data['Hinselmann']==0)]\n\n\nHinselmannstdpercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'STD': ['condylomatosis','cervical condylomatosis','vaginal condylomatosis','vulvo-perineal condylomatosis',\n                      'syphilis','pelvic inflammatory disease','genital herpes','molluscum contagiosum','AIDS','HIV',\n                      'Hepatitis B','HPV'],\n              'Percentage': [Hinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:condylomatosis'].mean()*100, Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:cervical condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             Hinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:vaginal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             Hinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:syphilis'].mean()*100,Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease'].mean()*100,\n                             Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:genital herpes'].mean()*100,Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:molluscum contagiosum'].mean()*100,\n                             Hinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:AIDS'].mean()*100,Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:HIV'].mean()*100,Hinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:Hepatitis B'].mean()*100,\n                             Hinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:HPV'].mean()*100]})\nnoHinselmannstdpercentages = pd.DataFrame({\n              'STD': ['condylomatosis','cervical condylomatosis','vaginal condylomatosis','vulvo-perineal condylomatosis',\n                      'syphilis','pelvic inflammatory disease','genital herpes','molluscum contagiosum','AIDS','HIV',\n                      'Hepatitis B','HPV'],\n              'Percentage': [noHinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:condylomatosis'].mean()*100, noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:cervical condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             noHinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:vaginal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis'].mean()*100,\n                             noHinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:syphilis'].mean()*100,noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease'].mean()*100,\n                             noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:genital herpes'].mean()*100,noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:molluscum contagiosum'].mean()*100,\n                             noHinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:AIDS'].mean()*100,noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:HIV'].mean()*100,noHinselmanndata.loc[:,'STDs:Hepatitis B'].mean()*100,\n                             noHinselmanndata.loc[:, 'STDs:HPV'].mean()*100]})\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nX_axis = np.arange(Hinselmannstdpercentages.shape[0])\n\nplt.bar(X_axis -

I created a network analysis visualization with green nodes representing patients and pink nodes representing test methods. I changed the color of the edges to represent each test so it was easy to see the relationship between the patients and the tests they underwent.\n\nG = nx.Graph()\n\nG.add_node('Biopsy')\nG.add_node('Hinselmann')\nG.add_node('Schiller')\n\nedgecolors = []\nnodecolors = []\n\nfor i in range(data.shape[0]):\n    if data.loc[i,'Biopsy']:\n        G.add_node(i)\n        G.add_edge(i, 'Biopsy')\n    if data.loc[i,'Hinselmann']:\n        G.add_node(i)\n        G.add_edge(i, 'Hinselmann')\n    if data.loc[i,'Schiller']:\n        G.add_node(i)\n        G.add_edge(i, 'Schiller')\n\nfor j in G.edges:\n  if j[0] == 'Biopsy':\n    edgecolors.append('red')\n  elif j[0] == 'Hinselmann':\n    edgecolors.append('yellow')\n  elif j[0] == 'Schiller':\n    edgecolors.append('blue')\n    \n\nfor i in range(len(G.nodes)):\n    if i > 2:\n        nodecolors.append('green')\n    else:\n        nodecolors.append('pink')\n        \nnx.draw(G, edge_color = edgecolors, node_size = 10, node_color = nodecolors)\n\n\n\n\nPerforming network analysis reveals that most common test to be the Schiller test. I used three metrics to check this, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. Degree centrality measures the number of edges connected to each node. Betweenness centrality measures how often a node is part of the shortest path connecting other nodes. Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to the other nodes. Schiller has the highest value for all three so it is the most central to all the nodes.\n\nprint('Degree Centrality')\nC = nx.degree_centrality(G)\nprint('Biopsy Centrality =',C['Biopsy'])\nprint('Hinselmann Centrality =',C['Hinselmann'])\nprint('Schiller Centrality =',C['Schiller'])\nprint('Betweenness Centrality')\nB = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)\nprint('Biopsy Betweeness =',B['Biopsy'])\nprint('Hinselmann Betweeness =',B['Hinselmann'])\nprint('Schiller Betweeness =',B['Schiller'])\nprint('Closeness Centrality')\nL = nx.closeness_centrality(G)\nprint('Biopsy Closeness =',L['Biopsy'])\nprint('Hinselmann Closeness =',L['Hinselmann'])\nprint('Schiller Closeness =',L['Schiller'])\n\nDegree Centrality\nBiopsy Centrality = 0.6547619047619048\nHinselmann Centrality = 0.41666666666666663\nSchiller Centrality = 0.8809523809523809\nBetweenness Centrality\nBiopsy Betweeness = 0.31368087361552754\nHinselmann Betweeness = 0.09700445618088799\nSchiller Betweeness = 0.6311964831697348\nCloseness Centrality\nBiopsy Closeness = 0.6\nHinselmann Closeness = 0.4666666666666667\nSchiller Closeness = 0.8235294117647058\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nIn this research project, I analyzed cervical cancer risk factor data in an effort to draw conclusions about what factors contribute to a patient’s risk of developing the cancer.\nThroughout my analysis, I did not find a stong correlation between the surveyed behaviors and risk for contracting the surveyed STDs. This was surprising. I expected to see positive correlation between the number of sexual partners someone has and the number of STDs someone is diagnosed with. I assumed the more sexual encounters one has, the more diseases one is exposed to, the more STDs one will contract, similar to the more someone drives, the more likely they are to get into a car accident, no matter how good of a driver they are. Based on the scatterplots made of the data, this was proven to not be true.\nThe lack of correlations could be due to the limited demographic surveyed by the researchers. All the data was collected at one hospital, in a brief time period. The sample size does seem large enough to capture a complete range of responses. Another possible source of error is the data collection relies on self reporting. Sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted diseases are highly taboo subjects, survey respondents may not feel entirely comfortable reporting this kind of information about themselves and could alter the truth. If subjects volunteer to participate, there is also a particular type of person that is going to be willing to answer questions about their sexual history and this might skew the type of responses received.\nI also analyzed the relationship between the experiences, behaviors, and STD diagnoses of patients with whether they were tested for cervical cancer. From making bar charts, I was able to determine risk factors that made patients more likely to be tested. These factors are being diagnosed with condylomatosis, vulvo-perineal condylomatosis, or HIV, smoking and using hormonal birth control.\nThe higher rates of smoking and STDs made sense as risk factors because both of these lead to poorer health for the patient, putting them at a greater risk for getting sick. I was surprised however by such a significant difference in rates of birth control usage, I expected to see no difference. These findings however were supported by the American Cancer Society and an article on WebMD. In an article by Kelli Miller, it is stated that taking oral contraceptives, which are hormonal, will decrease the risk of endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, but could increase the risk of breast cancer and cervical cancer. This was shocking to read because I had never heard that discussed. Although I am not taking oral contraceptives, I do use hormonal birth control and that risk is not something I had ever had explained to me. It is important that information like this is commonly known so that patients, especially ones that already are at higher risk for cervical cancer, know all the effects of their medication.\nIn conclusion, research into women’s sexual health is important for protecting their safety. A woman needs to be able to evaluate herself, recognize risks, and communicate with healthcare providers because often she will be the only one doing so. Being properly educated on how to protect oneself against sexually transmitted diseases, side effects of medication, and the risk factors of developing cervical cancer is a valuable skill, possibly life saving.\n\n\nReferences\nCardoso, Jaime S., et al. “Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) Data Set.” UCI Machine Learning Repository, University of California, Irvine, 3 Mar. 2017, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29.\nLevine, Hallie. “Oral Contraceptives and Cervical Cancer: What to Know.” Reviewed by Nivin Todd, WebMD, WebMD, 21 June 2022, https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills-cervical-cancer.\nMiller, Kelli. “Birth Control & Cancer: Which Methods Raise, Lower Risk.” American Cancer Society, 21 Jan. 2016, https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/birth-control-cancer-which-methods-raise-lower-risk.html.\nPagán, Camille Noe. “When Doctors Downplay Women’s Health Concerns.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 3 May 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/well/live/when-doctors-downplay-womens-health-concerns.html."
